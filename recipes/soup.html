        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <b>Basic chicken soup</b> is made out of chicken and all sorts of vegetables and chicken. It is a delicious dish to eat
            before the manin meal, and very healthy also! </p>
            <p>This version has classic flavors and, thanks to a simplified method, cooks more quickly than traditional chicken soups, 
                as the dish is ready in a little over an hour. There's no need to make a separate stock, the vegetables and meat form their
                own satisfying broth.
